TO THE

Q U E E N.

May it pleasb Your llIajcsty,

HIS Second Volume gives a View of what passed worthy of Memory‚ during the Reign of
T Your most Noble Progenitor‚ King Edward the First·‚ a Prince the most Renown'd for
Arms in that A e.

And that wasgan Age of much War and Affion, and of many famous Captains·, Albertus the
Great‚ Duke of Brmffwc'ck5 le'lliam the Great‚ Marquiss of filonzflrat5 Amadeus the Great,
Count of Savoy ς three of King Edward’s nearest Kindred, and his Familiar53 each of them by
their Signal Condu& and Bravery, had the Title Great added for their Surname.

These were great Captains in that Age·, but many Ages, many Atchievements Toils , and
Traverses of W ar pass, many new Stars rise and disappear, many Comets blaze and vanis h, and
a long Course of Years is run before the &Vorld behold any thing so transcendent as, most ‘Dread

Severezgn, is reserved for the Glory of Your auspicious Reign; 1 mean, so important a Battel,
so signal a Vi&ory‚ and so distinguish’d a Captain.

Germany , one may reckon, has twice been saved by the English.
To that Nation, about a Thousand Years ago, from Your County of Damon, on a Spiritual

Expedition ‚ march’d St. [Vinifrid (whom they call the Apostle of Germany) and from their Ido-
latry converted them to the Christian Faith.

And now Your Most Excellent llIajelh‘ (the same Divine Grace aflisting) has rescued them
from te French, and brought them to their Allegiance 3 He instrusted them to fear GOD,
and You have taught them to obey Caefizr.

Thus You provide for the Peace and Felicity of Your People , and of Your Neighbour
Princes3 for the present Time, and for Futurity.

But Your Noble unbounded Piety looks back also upon Ages by-past : Your Archives are
the Magazine from whence You give out Arms to rescue from Oblivion the A&s and Monu-
ments of Your Royal Ancestors·, and secure them from the Injury and Enterprizes of Time.

Some, whose Memory was doubtful, some, desperate and eclips'd totally, You bring again
to Light‚ and adorn with a new Lustre.

One of these here, under Your Condu&³ makes his Entry into the World; you shew him

in his Publick Ads of State3 and attended ‚ as becomes a King, with his Lords Spiritual and Tem-
poral‚ his Bishops and his Barons.

Yet this Crown‘d Head, dropt, as it were, and lost in the Dark, not known in History‚

>vasa¹ Son-in-Law to King Alexander the Third ‚ and F ather to a Sovereign Qeen of Scot-
an ,-

A Qieen , whose Life was the most precious ‚ and who was defign’d for a Band of
U NION betwixt Your two Kingdoms ‚ Englcmd and scotland ‚- But this ‚ most gracious

Sorereign, is a Blessing also reserv’d to be accomplish’d in your most Glorious Reign: Which
GOD long continue. So prays,

Your Most sacred llffajeffly's‚
Most devoted Servant,

T. RYMER.
